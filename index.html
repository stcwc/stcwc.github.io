    <p>Hi I am Wangchao, originally from China, now studying computer science at Rutgers University. What am I like? I like coding and boating, hacking and hiking, NFA and NBA, James Gosling and James Harden. I would like to be full stack, both in my career and life. Perfect is scary, but I want to be close to it.</p>
